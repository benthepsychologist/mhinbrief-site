<!-- ⚠️ LOCAL OVERRIDE of the kit-rendered site agentdoc, 2026-08-01.
     The rendered template described a DIFFERENT site: it named
     content/threads|entities|map|claim as the generated dirs, content/about.md
     and content/metric/* as the hand-authored ones, and assets/css/ as the
     stylesheet location. NONE of those seven paths exist in this repo — they
     are theprojection-site's content model, which is an attention-kind
     instance. It also placed the adapter in kestrel, said this site was "fed
     by" itself, and pointed "data/instance repo" at this repo rather than at
     therapybulletin-data. Left as-is it would tell a session that
     content/changelog (which IS generated) is safe to hand-edit, and send it
     looking for directories that do not exist.

     kit.py sync will flag this file DIRTY on the next library bump. Resolve
     with `install --adopt` or `--skip`, never `--discard`. A correction for
     the canonical template is filed in kestrel/INBOX/. -->

# CLAUDE.md — therapybulletin-site

This repo is the **published surface only** — a Hugo site with exactly one
content writer: the `therapybulletin` adapter at
`/workspace/therapybulletin-data/publish/adapter.py`, which calls kestrel's
publish core (`/workspace/kestrel/tools/publish/core.py`) for the guarantees
(secret scan, field allowlist, no-empty-wipe, provenance). The adapter is
**instance code in the data repo**, not engine code.

**Single-writer contract — what is GENERATED here, never hand-edit:**
- `content/changelog/*.md` — one page per changelog entry
- `data/records.yaml` — allowlisted record fields
- `data/regulators.yaml` — the jurisdiction map's regulator lists

Edits to any of those belong upstream, in `therapybulletin-data` (the
records/changelog, or the adapter that renders them). A second writer into
this site is the specific failure mode the contract exists to prevent — a
temporary bridge script once produced `data/regulators.yaml` from inside
this repo and was absorbed into the adapter and deleted on 2026-07-31.

**Hand-authored pages that are this repo's own** and are never touched by
publish: `content/_index.md`, `content/method.md`, `content/newsletter.md`,
and the section framing pages `content/jurisdictions/_index.md`,
`content/topics/_index.md`, `content/topics/tax.md`. These carry editorial
prose only — never record facts, citations, dates, or figures, which must
come from `data/` at render time.

**What else IS this repo's own code:** `layouts/`, `static/` (including
`static/css/main.css` — note `static/`, not `assets/`), `static/img/`,
`static/js/`, `hugo.yaml`, `wrangler.toml`. Templates, brand system and
site config are edited and pushed here directly, same as any Hugo site.

**Deploy — the trap:** this site does **NOT** auto-deploy on git push. It
builds only when its Cloudflare deploy hook fires. `/publish --push` from
the data repo fires it; a bare template/CSS push does not. After any
direct push here, fire it by hand:

    source .env && curl -X POST "$THERAPYBULLETIN_DEPLOY_HOOK"

The hook URL lives in this repo's gitignored `.env` (see `.env.example`).
A clean `git push` is not evidence the site updated — verify against
served content.

**Upstream pointers:** engine — `/workspace/kestrel`; data/instance repo —
`/workspace/therapybulletin-data`.
